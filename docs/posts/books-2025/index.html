<section id="introduction" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>I didn’t read much before 2025. But this year, something changed. I picked up a few books, and before I knew it, reading became a habit I actually enjoy.</p>
<p>Here’s everything I read - the feel-good, the emotional, and the funny - along with my honest thoughts.</p>
<hr>
</section>
<section id="mythology-indian-literature" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="mythology-indian-literature">Mythology &amp; Indian Literature</h2>
<section id="the-forest-of-enchantments" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-forest-of-enchantments">The Forest of Enchantments</h3>
<p><em>Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni</em></p>
<p><strong>My favourite read of the year</strong> - In this, Sita’s character is portrayed in a way that reflects every woman in this male-dominated world. Literally, I cried while reading; it felt like I could relate to Sita’s story in one way or another. Seeing how things have still not changed, even though this is a story from long ago. Must read.</p>
<p>The Ramayana is still meaningful today, but the author makes it feel even more relevant. The novel asks important questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How should women be treated by those who claim to love them?</li>
<li>What rights do they have in a relationship?</li>
<li>At what point must a woman draw the line and say, ‘Enough!’</li>
</ul>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Would I recommend?</strong> Absolutely yes! A must-read for everyone.</p>
</blockquote>

<section id="the-palace-of-illusions" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-palace-of-illusions">The Palace of Illusions</h3>
<p><em>Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni</em></p>
<p>First, I was feeling anger, not just at the men, but at the system the book exposes. What would trouble me most is that Draupadi is intelligent, aware, and questioning, yet still trapped. Her suffering doesn’t come from ignorance; it comes from structures she cannot break, even when gods are watching. That silence - of elders, gods, and society - would feel heavier than the violence itself.</p>
<p>Second, I have felt deeply disturbed by female complicity, especially Kunti’s role. As a woman, that would hurt more than male cruelty. It shows how patriarchy survives not only through men’s power, but through women being forced (or conditioned) to protect it - even at the cost of another woman’s life. That realization is uncomfortable, but painfully real.</p>
<p>Finally, as a woman, I didn’t find the book enjoyable in a comforting or pleasing way. Instead, it left a lasting emotional impact. It made me feel disturbed and uneasy, and it pushed me to think seriously about how injustices from the past are still reflected in today’s world.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Would I recommend?</strong> Yes, but be prepared for an emotional journey.</p>

<section id="more-days-at-the-morisaki-bookshop" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="more-days-at-the-morisaki-bookshop">More Days at the Morisaki Bookshop</h3>
<p><em>Satoshi Yagisawa</em></p>
<p>This book gives a sense of calm and peace. It is a slow, smooth story, and while reading it, I started wishing that I too could own a small bookshop—where I could go every day, have a cup of coffee from the corner café mentioned in the book, read, smell old books, and spend my whole life like that.</p>
<p>Through this book, I discovered the pleasure of reading.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Would I recommend?</strong> Yes, perfect for a cozy weekend read.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="diary-of-a-wimpy-kid-the-meltdown-the-getaway">Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Meltdown &amp; The Getaway</h3>
<p><em>Jeff Kinney</em></p>
<p>These two books I finished in one sitting. I don’t know about you, but I like reading books that have pictures. I might not be able to fully relate to Greg Heffley, as an Indian born and brought up in a small village in the 90s, you don’t get exposure to all these things. But the Wimpy Kid books are so funny and enjoyable that you just want to finish them to know the end - even though, deep inside, you know that Greg Heffley and his family will have an embarrassing moment or that they won’t win. Still, it’s fun to know how it all ends.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Would I recommend?</strong> Yes! Great for when you need a laugh.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-secret-diary-of-adrian-mole-aged-13-34">The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, Aged 13 3/4</h3>
<p><em>Sue Townsend</em></p>
<p>This is a very funny book. I like the ideas that go through Adrian Mole’s mind and the way he thinks he is undernourished or has vitamin deficiencies because of his pimple. His self-dramatic thinking is exactly what makes the diary entries funny.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed reading this book. I also like the way Adrian’s innocence is shown. He thinks his mother and father are fighting over who wants to keep him, but in reality, neither of them really wants him.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Would I recommend?</strong> Yes, a classic British humor gem!</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="abroad-in-japan">Abroad in Japan</h3>
<p><em>Chris Broad</em></p>
<p>You all might know that I work as a geospatial engineer, and in 2026, the FOSS4G conference will be held in Japan. With that thought in mind, I started exploring books that could give me more details about the culture, food, and almost everything about Japan. Also, through this book, I was manifesting my trip to Japan in 2026.</p>
<p>This book is interesting to read, and I am amazed by the beauty of the Japanese people, culture and beliefs.</p>
<p>Everybody has their own views on it - I explored the YouTube channel of the author, and somehow I am just not able to relate to the person in the videos as the same person as the book’s author. I like his book version more than him as a content creator on YouTube.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Would I recommend?</strong> Yes, especially if you’re planning to visit Japan!</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="lets-talk-money">Let’s Talk Money</h3>
<p><em>Monika Halan</em></p>
<p>I am very new to the world of investments and savings. This book is a really good place to start. It gives a clear idea of how things work in the Indian context. The book encourages building financial discipline instead of blindly following traditional beliefs.</p>
<p>Through this book, I learned that our gold and silver jewellery or ornaments are not productive assets.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Would I recommend?</strong> Yes! Essential for Indians starting their financial journey.</p>

<p>None of this would have happened without the people who nudged me towards books this year. So here’s a little shoutout:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Awais Ahmed</strong> — CEO of Pixxel Space. Watching someone so busy still make time to read reminded me that there’s always time if you really want it.</li>
<li><strong>Utsha Jain</strong> — My Babhi, she keeps posting her reading experiences, and honestly, that’s what motivated me to read more.</li>
<li><strong>alexandbooks</strong> — A Twitter account I stumbled upon, and now my wishlist is dangerously long because of him.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Happy reading! What books did you read this year? I’d love to hear your recommendations.</em></p>
