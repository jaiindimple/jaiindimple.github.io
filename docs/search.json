    "text": "Mythology & Indian Literature\n\nThe Forest of Enchantments\nChitra Banerjee Divakaruni\nMy favourite read of the year - In this, Sita’s character is portrayed in a way that reflects every woman in this male-dominated world. Literally, I cried while reading; it felt like I could relate to Sita’s story in one way or another. Seeing how things have still not changed, even though this is a story from long ago. Must read.\nThe Ramayana is still meaningful today, but the author makes it feel even more relevant. The novel asks important questions:\n\nHow should women be treated by those who claim to love them?\nWhat rights do they have in a relationship?\nAt what point must a woman draw the line and say, ‘Enough!’\n\n\nWould I recommend? Absolutely yes! A must-read for everyone.\n\n\n\n\nThe Palace of Illusions\nChitra Banerjee Divakaruni\nFirst, I was feeling anger, not just at the men, but at the system the book exposes. What would trouble me most is that Draupadi is intelligent, aware, and questioning, yet still trapped. Her suffering doesn’t come from ignorance; it comes from structures she cannot break, even when gods are watching. That silence - of elders, gods, and society - would feel heavier than the violence itself.\nSecond, I have felt deeply disturbed by female complicity, especially Kunti’s role. As a woman, that would hurt more than male cruelty. It shows how patriarchy survives not only through men’s power, but through women being forced (or conditioned) to protect it - even at the cost of another woman’s life. That realization is uncomfortable, but painfully real.\nFinally, as a woman, I didn’t find the book enjoyable in a comforting or pleasing way. Instead, it left a lasting emotional impact. It made me feel disturbed and uneasy, and it pushed me to think seriously about how injustices from the past are still reflected in today’s world.\n\nWould I recommend? Yes, but be prepared for an emotional journey."

It is a slow, smooth story, and while reading it, I started wishing that I too could own a small bookshop—where I could go every day, have a cup of coffee from the corner café mentioned in the book, read, smell old books, and spend my whole life like that.\nThrough this book, I discovered the pleasure of reading.\n\nWould I recommend? Yes, perfect for a cozy weekend read."

I don’t know about you, but I like reading books that have pictures. I might not be able to fully relate to Greg Heffley, as an Indian born and brought up in a small village in the 90s, you don’t get exposure to all these things. But the Wimpy Kid books are so funny and enjoyable that you just want to finish them to know the end - even though, deep inside, you know that Greg Heffley and his family will have an embarrassing moment or that they won’t win. Still, it’s fun to know how it all ends.\n\nWould I recommend? Yes! Great for when you need a laugh.\n\n\n\n\nThe Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, Aged 13 3/4\nSue Townsend\nThis is a very funny book. I like the ideas that go through Adrian Mole’s mind and the way he thinks he is undernourished or has vitamin deficiencies because of his pimple. His self-dramatic thinking is exactly what makes the diary entries funny.\nI really enjoyed reading this book. I also like the way Adrian’s innocence is shown. He thinks his mother and father are fighting over who wants to keep him, but in reality, neither of them really wants him.\n\nWould I recommend? Yes, a classic British humor gem!"

With that thought in mind, I started exploring books that could give me more details about the culture, food, and almost everything about Japan. Also, through this book, I was manifesting my trip to Japan in 2026.\nThis book is interesting to read, and I am amazed by the beauty of the Japanese people, culture and beliefs.\nEverybody has their own views on it - I explored the YouTube channel of the author, and somehow I am just not able to relate to the person in the videos as the same person as the book’s author. I like his book version more than him as a content creator on YouTube.\n\nWould I recommend? Yes, especially if you’re planning to visit Japan!"

    "text": "Dynamic vs. Static Tiles: What’s the Difference?\nStatic tiles are like pre-printed map pieces stored in folders. Once created, they’re locked—changing anything means starting over. They use lots of storage but load quickly.\nTiTiler’s dynamic tiles work like a chef cooking to order. When someone views your map, TiTiler grabs just the data needed and creates tiles on the spot. This lets you instantly change colors, adjust contrast, or highlight different features. Your map becomes flexible and responsive, adapting to what users need right now rather than being stuck with choices made earlier."

    "text": "Let’s Get TiTiler Up and Running!\nNow that we understand the advantage of TiTiler’s dynamic approach, let’s get it running on your local machine. Follow these steps:\n\n1. Create Your Project Workspace\nFirst, let’s create a dedicated space for our TiTiler project. Open your terminal (Command Prompt or PowerShell on Windows, Terminal on macOS/Linux) and run:\n# Works on all operating systems\nmkdir Titiler\ncd Titiler\n\n💡 Pro Tip: Keeping your TiTiler project in its own folder makes it easier to manage and prevents conflicts with other Python projects.\n\n\n\n2. Set Up a Python Virtual Environment\n\nCreate the virtual environment:\npython -m venv titiler\nActivate the virtual environment:\n\nFor Linux/macOS:\nsource titiler/bin/activate\nFor Windows:\ntitiler\\Scripts\\activate\n\n\n\n\n3. Install TiTiler and Its Dependencies\nWith your environment activated, install TiTiler and the web server it needs:\npip install titiler.core uvicorn\nThis command installs the core TiTiler package and Uvicorn, a lightning-fast ASGI server.\n\n💡 What’s happening: TiTiler.core contains the essential functionality for serving map tiles. Uvicorn is the engine that will run our FastAPI application.\n\n\n\n4. Create Your TiTiler Application\nNow for the fun part! Create a file named main.py with the following code:\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI\nfrom titiler.core.factory import TilerFactory\n\nfrom starlette.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware\n\napp = FastAPI()\n\n# Add CORS middleware\napp.add_middleware(\n    CORSMiddleware,\n    allow_origins=[\"*\"],  # Allows all origins (for development - be more specific in production)\n    allow_credentials=True,\n    allow_methods=[\"*\"],\n    allow_headers=[\"*\"],\n)\n\n# Create a TilerFactory for Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFFs\ncog = TilerFactory()\n\n# Register all the COG endpoints automatically\napp.include_router(cog.router, tags=[\"Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF\"])\n\n\n# Optional: Add a welcome message for the root endpoint\n@app.get(\"/\")\ndef read_index():\n    return {\"message\": \"Welcome to TiTiler\"}\n\n💡 Code Breakdown:\n\nWe create a FastAPI app and add CORS middleware to allow web maps to access our images\nThe TilerFactory() creates all the endpoints needed for serving COG tiles\nWe include those endpoints in our app with app.include_router()\nA simple home endpoint provides a welcome message\n\n\n\n\n5. Launch Your TiTiler Server\nRun the following command to start the server:\nuvicorn main:app --reload\nYou should see output similar to this:\n\n\n💡 The --reload flag automatically restarts the server whenever you change your code - perfect for development!\n\n\n\n6. Explore Your TiTiler API\nOpen your browser and go to:\nhttp://127.0.0.1:8000/ - See your welcome message\n\nhttp://127.0.0.1:8000/docs - Explore the interactive API documentation. The /docs page is your mission control center. It shows all the endpoints TiTiler created for you and lets you test them directly in your browser:"

    "title": "Getting started with TiTiler",
    "section": "Visualizing a Specific Tile (Z, X, Y)",
    "text": "Visualizing a Specific Tile (Z, X, Y)\nWhen working with web maps, understanding tile coordinates is essential. Let’s break down what Z, X, Y values mean:\n\nZ (zoom level): How far in/out you’re zoomed. Lower numbers (0-5) show the whole world with less detail; higher numbers (15-22) show smaller areas with more detail.\nX (column): Horizontal position, increasing eastward.\nY (row): Vertical position, increasing southward.\n\nAt zoom level 0, there’s just 1 tile for the whole world. Each zoom level increase splits each tile into 4 more detailed tiles.\n\nWhy Visualize Specific Tiles?\n\nPerformance: Load only what users can see\nDebugging: Inspect problematic tiles\nSpecific Analysis: Extract data from exact locations\n\n\n\nFinding Z, X, Y for Your Image\nThe mercantile library makes this straightforward:\nimport mercantile\nimport rasterio\n\n# Open your GeoTIFF file\nwith rasterio.open('/path/to/your/raster.tif') as src:\n    bbox = src.bounds\n    zoom = 15\n\n    # Find all tiles covering the bounding box\n    tiles = list(mercantile.tiles(bbox[0], bbox[1], bbox[2], bbox[3], zoom))\n\n    for t in tiles:\n        print(\"Tile coordinate (x, y, z):\", t.x, t.y, t.z)\n\n\nViewing a Specific Tile in TiTiler\nFor example, if your tile has coordinates x=5412, y=12463, z=15, you would access specific tile with:\nhttp://127.0.0.1:8000/tiles/WebMercatorQuad/15/5412/12463.png?url=raster.tif\nURL components explained:\n\nWebMercatorQuad/: The tiling scheme (this should match your raster’s CRS - TiTiler will reproject on-the-fly if needed, but using the correct scheme improves performance and accuracy)\n{z}/{x}/{y}: Your tile coordinates\n.png: Output format (alternatives: .jpg, .webp, .tif)\n?url=raster.tif: Source raster file\n\n\n\nCreating a Web Map with Leaflet\nLeaflet is a lightweight, open-source JavaScript library for interactive maps. It lets you combine base maps (like OpenStreetMap) with overlays from custom tile servers such as TiTiler.\nThe following code (in map.html) loads a base map, adds your TiTiler raster overlay, and automatically sets the map’s view to the raster’s bounds:\n\nmap.html Code:\n&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;\n  &lt;title&gt;Leaflet Basemap + TiTiler Raster Overlay&lt;/title&gt;\n  &lt;meta charset=\"utf-8\"&gt;\n  &lt;meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"initial-scale=1.0\"&gt;\n  &lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.9.4/dist/leaflet.css\" /&gt;\n  &lt;script src=\"https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.9.4/dist/leaflet.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;\n  &lt;div id=\"map\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 600px;\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;script&gt;\n    // Initialize the map with OpenStreetMap as the basemap\n    var map = L.map('map').setView([0, 0], 2);\n    L.tileLayer('https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png', {\n      maxZoom: 19,\n      attribution: '&copy; OpenStreetMap contributors'\n    }).addTo(map);\n\n    /// Define the local raster path and TiTiler endpoint\n    // Replace with your own full GeoTIFF path - use the appropriate format for your OS.\n    var rasterPath = 'file:///path_to_your_raster.tif';\n    var titilerUrl = 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/tiles/WebMercatorQuad/{z}/{x}/{y}.png?url=' + encodeURIComponent(rasterPath);\n\n    // Add the TiTiler raster overlay with some transparency\n    L.tileLayer(titilerUrl, {\n      tileSize: 256,\n      opacity: 0.7,\n      maxZoom: 22\n    }).addTo(map);\n\n    // Fetch the raster's bounding box from TiTiler and adjust the map view accordingly\n    var boundsUrl = 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/bounds?url=' + encodeURIComponent(rasterPath);\n    console.log(boundsUrl)\n    fetch(boundsUrl)\n      .then(response =&gt; response.json())\n      .then(data =&gt; {\n        console.log(\"Bounds data:\", data);\n        if (data && data.bounds) {\n          // data.bounds is [minX, minY, maxX, maxY]\n          var b = data.bounds;\n          // Convert to Leaflet bounds: [[southWest_lat, southWest_lng], [northEast_lat, northEast_lng]]\n          var leafletBounds = [[b[1], b[0]], [b[3], b[2]]];\n          map.fitBounds(leafletBounds);\n        } else {\n          console.error(\"No bounds returned from TiTiler.\");\n        }\n      })\n      .catch(error =&gt; console.error(\"Error fetching bounds:\", error));\n\n  &lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;"
